    "\n",
    "By using `np.log(poisson.pmf(k,mu))` instead of `poisson.logpmf(k,mu)`,  the median error increases from ~3.4cm to ~6.4cm. When plotting the decoded position next to the true position, it is clear that `np.log(poisson.pmf(k,mu))` wrongly decodes the position as the first bin much more often than `np.log(poisson.pmf(k,mu))` does. This difference is due to the term `pow(1,-15)` being added after the `log` operation in the original version, but before the `log` operation in the modified version. In order to fix this, `+ pow(1,-15)` has to be added after the `log` operation, and the warning given by taking the logarithm of 0 can be ignored."
