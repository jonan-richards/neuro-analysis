    "When changing the values for the center and width of the frequency band, a few observations can be made. First of all, increasing the band width tends to increase the complexity of the filtered signal. This makes sense, as this increases the number of frequencies that contribute to this signal. Another observation, made when keeping the band width low (around 1 or 2) and changing the frequency is that the lower frequencies tend to contribute more to the signal than higher frequencies (i.e. they have a higher amplitude). Increasing the order of the filter while keeping the frequency band fixed increases the processing time seemingly linearly, from  0.09ms at an order of 1, 0.30ms at 50, and 0.59ms at 99. Additionally it seems to delay the onset and phase of filtered signal. Increasing the order to very high values seems to make the filter instable, as some random combinations of band center and width can make the filtered signal grow to many times the amplitude of the raw signal, or completely vanish."

[Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep) is a well studied phase, with clear markers that make it detectable from LFP data.

During REM sleep, the former dominates, in a pattern that resembles active behaviour.  \n",
